A Quantile-Quantile (QQ) plot is a graphical tool used in statistics to assess whether a given dataset follows a particular theoretical distribution. It compares the quantiles of the observed data with the quantiles of a specified theoretical distribution, often the normal distribution. The QQ plot is particularly useful for visually checking if the data deviates from the expected distribution.
